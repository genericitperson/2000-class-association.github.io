**MS4 - 27-28th Jun 20 - Itchenor SC (2 Day)**

**_Welcome to Itchenor Sailing Club, a lively and friendly sailing and racing club._**

We are one of the leading dinghy and keelboat sailing clubs in the UK, with family-friendly, multi-level fleets, a keen group of rowers and a busy social club. Located in beautiful Chichester Harbour, we are lucky enough to be in an area of outstanding natural beauty.

All competitors and their families are invited to use the facilities of the Club, during their stay. They will be deemed to be Temporary Members for the duration of the event, and as such, shall abide by all the Club's rules and traditions.

Bar and catering facilities will be available for the duration of the event. A supper for sailors and their families is planned for the Saturday evening. Please book for this supper either on the Entry Form or at the club office.

Please note the boat berthing information.

BERTHING AND TRAILERS

1\.1 Boats shall be kept in their assigned area on the ISC landing stage.

1\.2 Please note that the staging could get wet at high water so all gear and valuables should be left secure. Boats staying on the stage overnight should be tied down.

1\.3 Trailers must be manhandled from the road to the Club stage as vehicles are not permitted down the Club Lane. Parking for cars is available at the Harbour Conservancy car park (Pay & Display).

Road Trailers may remain on the staging; however, the staging may flood at high water Spring Tides.

1\.4 For sailors arriving at the club with a boat on a road trailer, especially at busy times, it is simplest to go straight into the Conservancy Pay and Display Car Park, unhitch and wheel the boat plus sailing kit down Club Lane on to the stage. Road trailers may be left in the car park or on the stage under your dinghy. Cars are not permitted in the club lane.
