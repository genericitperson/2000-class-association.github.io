Welcome to Wilsonian Sailing Club

Wilsonian Sailing Club was founded in 1959 and is located on the north shore of the River Medway close to the village of Hoo, near Rochester in Kent. It prides itself on being a very friendly club that welcomes visitors and new members. It is probably the largest club solely for dinghy sailors in the north of Kent.

The club is located in woodland on a south-facing hillside next to a shingle beach from which you can launch and recover dinghies at any stage of the tide. We have a full racing and training programme and the river provides an excellent cruising area. River Medway - large tidal estuary.
